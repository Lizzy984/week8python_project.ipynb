Project Title
Brief description of the project and its goals.

Project Structure
your_notebook_name.ipynb: This is the main notebook containing the data loading, cleaning, analysis, and visualization steps.
app.py: This file contains the code for the Streamlit application. (You would have created this file by saving the Streamlit code from the notebook).
/content/country_wise_latest.csv: The dataset used for this project.
How to Run the Notebook
You can run the cells in this Google Colab notebook sequentially to execute the data loading, cleaning, analysis, and visualization steps.

How to Run the Streamlit Application
Save the code from the Streamlit code cell (cell ID e6bd666f) as a Python file named app.py.
Open your terminal or command prompt.
Navigate to the directory where you saved app.py.
Run the command: streamlit run app.py
The Streamlit app should open in your web browser. If running in a remote environment like Colab, you might need to use a service like ngrok to expose the port.

Streamlit
Future Improvements (Optional)
Mention any potential future enhancements or analyses that could be done.

To run this Streamlit app, you will need to save the code above as a Python file (e.g., app.py) and then run it from your terminal using the command streamlit run app.py.

Note: Running Streamlit apps directly within Colab has some limitations. You might need to use ngrok or a similar service to expose your local Colab port to the internet to view the app in your browser.
